Is-Odd and Is-Even as a Service

This is a completely serious project totally not meant to copy [is-odd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) and [is-even](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-even), built using ✨AI✨.

To visit the documentation, please visit this [link](https://b337sm.deta.dev/redoc) (Update: Temporarily down.). Essentially,


`$ curl https://b337sm.deta.dev/check/NUMBER`

Both integer and float values are accepted and the output is in JSON format.
